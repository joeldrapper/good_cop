# Good Cop

Good Cop is a configuration for [RuboCop](https://rubocop.org) designed to improve developer happiness by being more agreeable than the default configuration. Just add this line to the top of your RuboCop config file to start using it today.

```
inherit_from: "https://www.goodcop.style/rubocop.yml"
